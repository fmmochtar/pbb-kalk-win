# pbb-kalk-win

**A simple PBB (Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan) calculator written in C#.**

This program is one of my first C# project intended as final project for Basics of Computer Programming practices.

##### What it does

- Calculate PBB based on your data input.
- Calculate NJOP, NJOPTKP, and etc.

No executables are provided here, so you need to compile it by yourself.

##### Requirements for compiling

- Visual Studio 2015 and later

##### Known issues

- Ctrl + (any button) has no any effects due to some keys blocked in order to prevent any inputs other than numbers.
- Looked sucks, right?
- You tell me.

##### Future plans

This program might get a better remake, with class and constructor implementation, and more.
